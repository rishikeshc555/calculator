        <h1 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Free Online Attendance Calculator for Students</h1>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-gray-600">
          For millions of students across India, managing college attendance is an intricate balancing act. Between preparing for competitive exams, completing rigorous assignments, participating in college fests, securing internships, and occasionally just needing a mental health break, attending every single lecture is practically impossible. This brings us to the most dreaded rule in the Indian education system: the mandatory <strong>75% attendance criteria</strong>.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Governed by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and enforced strictly by major institutions like Delhi University (DU), Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Anna University, and various IITs and NITs, failing to meet the 75% mark can have severe consequences. Students who fall short are frequently detained, denied their admit cards for semester exams, or penalized heavily in their internal assessment marks. 
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Because of these strict regulations, "bunking" classes must be done strategically rather than recklessly. You need to know exactly where your attendance stands at any given moment. Are you dangerously close to the detention zone, requiring you to attend the next two weeks of classes without fail? Or do you have a comfortable buffer of 85%, allowing you to safely skip a few morning lectures to study for an upcoming placement drive?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Our free online <strong>Attendance Calculator</strong> takes the anxiety out of college life. It is not just a simple percentage calculator; it is an intelligent planning tool. By entering your current class stats, it instantly tells you your current standing, exactly how many upcoming classes you must attend to escape the danger zone, or precisely how many classes you can safely miss ("bunk") while still keeping your academics completely secure.

      {/* --- CONSEQUENCES OF LOW ATTENDANCE --- */}
      <section className="bg-red-50/30 p-6 rounded-xl border border-red-100 shadow-sm mt-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The True Cost of Short Attendance in Indian Universities</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Why is it so important to track your classes meticulously? In the Indian higher education system, the penalties for "short attendance" are not just a slap on the wrist. They can actively delay your graduation and affect your career trajectory.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 text-gray-700">
          <li>
            <strong>Exam Detention (Year Back):</strong> The most severe and common punishment for dropping below the 75% mark (or 65% with a valid medical certificate) is being barred from writing the end-semester examinations. This often forces students to repeat the entire semester or year, delaying their graduation and placements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Loss of Internal Marks:</strong> Many universities allocate a specific percentage of internal assessment marks directly to attendance. Dropping from 85% to 70% might not just risk detention, but it could cost you 5 critical internal marks, lowering your overall CGPA or SGPA significantly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Condonation Fees:</strong> If your attendance is hovering in the borderline "gray zone" (usually between 65% and 74%), colleges may allow you to write the exams only after paying a hefty "condonation fee" or fine, which is an unnecessary financial burden on students and parents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Loss of Scholarships and Hostels:</strong> Certain merit-based scholarships, government fee-reimbursement schemes, and campus hostel allotments require students to maintain a spotless academic and attendance record.

        <p className="mb-4">Our tool is designed to be the ultimate companion for college students. It requires no sign-ups and works instantly on your smartphone. Follow these simple steps to analyze your attendance standing:</p>
        
        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-5">Step 1: Enter Classes Conducted</h3>
        <p className="mb-2 text-sm text-gray-600">This is the total number of lectures that have happened so far.</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700">
          <li>Check your university portal, ERP system, or ask your class representative for the total number of classes held to date.</li>
          <li>Enter this number into the <strong>"Total Classes Conducted"</strong> input box.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-5">Step 2: Enter Classes Attended</h3>
        <p className="mb-2 text-sm text-gray-600">This is how many times you were marked "Present."</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700">
          <li>Enter the exact number of lectures you have successfully attended in the <strong>"Total Classes Attended"</strong> box.</li>
          <li><em>Note: Make sure this number is smaller than or equal to the total classes conducted.</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-5">Step 3: Set Your Target Percentage</h3>
        <p className="mb-2 text-sm text-gray-600">Define the safety mark you wish to hit.</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4 text-sm text-gray-700">
          <li>By default, the calculator is pre-set to <strong>75%</strong> as it is the UGC standard across India.</li>
          <li>However, if your specific college requires 80%, or if you have a medical certificate lowering your requirement to 65%, simply type your new target into the <strong>"Target Attendance (%)"</strong> box.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="font-bold text-lg text-gray-900 mb-2 mt-5">Step 4: Read Your Action Plan</h3>

        <p className="mb-6">
          While finding a basic percentage is easy, calculating future class requirements involves a bit of algebra because every future class you attend changes both the numerator (attended) and the denominator (total).

              Yes, as per the University Grants Commission (UGC) and various regulatory bodies like AICTE, a minimum of 75% attendance is generally mandatory for students to be eligible to appear for their semester or final examinations. Some universities may offer a 10% relaxation (bringing it down to 65%) for valid medical reasons or for students participating in national-level sports, but the baseline remains 75%.

              If your attendance falls below the university's mandated cut-off, you may face severe academic consequences. The most common punishment is being "detained," which means you will be barred from writing your end-semester exams for that particular subject (or all subjects). Additionally, you may lose out on internal assessment marks or be required to pay a condonation fee if the shortage is minor.

              No, taking a medical leave does not automatically mark you as 'present' in the attendance register. However, if you submit a valid medical certificate from a registered doctor, the university administration may lower your personal attendance target (for example, reducing your minimum requirement from 75% down to 65%) as a special condonation. You must confirm this procedure with your specific college guidelines.

              Absolutely! While this tool is highly popular among college and university students because of the semester system, the mathematical formulas for calculating percentages and required days remain exactly the same for high school students (CBSE, ICSE, State Boards) tracking their annual attendance targets to be eligible for board exams.

            <summary className="font-semibold px-5 py-4 cursor-pointer text-gray-900 hover:bg-gray-50 transition-colors">What if I want to target 80% or 85% instead of 75%?</summary>
            <div className="px-5 pb-4 text-gray-600 border-t border-gray-100 pt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed">
              Our attendance calculator is fully customizable to your specific needs. While 75% is pre-filled as the default because it is the national university standard, you can simply click on the 'Target Attendance' input box and manually type in 80%, 85%, or any other target percentage required by your professors to calculate your specific requirements.
